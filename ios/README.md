# Bitmoji IOS Sample App

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you are using XCode 9.0+

The sample app uses Cocoapods to build dependencies. To get started, run

```
pod install --repo-update
```

### Set up

Add the client id and redirect in the [Info.plist](https://github.com/Snap-Kit/bitmoji-sample/blob/master/ios/BitmojiSampleApp/Supporting%20Files/Info.plist) file (See `CFBundleURLSchemes`, `SCSDKClientId` and `SCSDKRedirectUrl`).

Import `BitmojiSampleApp.xcworkspace` and start building!
